## Participation and Collaboration

The link for the event on Zoom will be provided later.
We will use Slido during [Q&A and interactive sessions](https://app.sli.do/event/c5h6G2qDj6V7751kHNdfkA).
Authors, presenters, and the audience are encouraged to <strong>raise controversial statements about utilizing humanities during SE research.</strong>
These statements will be collected during the workshop and discussed during the round-table discussions.

## Post-Workshop Technical Paper

We plan to publish a workshop memorandum paper with the summaries of the presentations and the discussions, as well as ideas for future research and the potential continuation of the workshop. All participants are free to join as authors. Details will be published later.

## Details of Presentation

The workshop will be held on March 18th, 2022 CET. Speakers will have 20 minutes for the talk, followed by 5 minutes for answering questions except for the keynote, which will be 45 minutes long, followed by 10 minutes of discussion. There will be a 5 minutes technical break between each talk.

We kindly ask the authors to send us a link to a prerecorded video version of their presentation. These will be used as a fallback option when someone cannot hold their presentation due to some technical difficulties. Please send the link to us in an e-mail to [human-conf@googlegroups.com](mailto:human-conf@googlegroups.com?subject=back-up video for HUMAN) with the subject "back-up video for HUMAN". You should specify the title of your paper in the body of the message. If there is no technical issue during the presentation, we will not publish or share these videos. We will discuss the follow-up steps with the authors in any other case. We prefer YouTube links with [unlisted privacy settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), but we accept other sharing platforms with common video formats, like `mp4`, `mkv`, `avi`, `mpg`, etc. The presentations and discussions may be recorded and published according to the guidelines and principles of the [SANER 2022 conference](https://saner2022.uom.gr/).
