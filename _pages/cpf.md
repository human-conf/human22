# Call for Paper Submissions

The 1st Workshop on Advances in Human-Centric Experiments in Software Engineering aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working in any field of Software Engineering, but with high interest in human-centric experiments, in particular, empirical evaluation of tools, processes and models which involves human participants. While much attention in the software engineering community is properly directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, it is the humans who will ultimately use the systems, and the proposed tools and methods. Hence, the use of appropriate methodologies to perform human-centric experiments remains a pressing concern. The workshop will strive for involving researchers and practitioners from fields other than computer science who have in-depth methodological knowledge about the applicable techniques, such as psychology and social sciences, thus providing an opportunity to share ideas and experiences among these communities.

## Topics

The topics of the submissions should be of direct interest to software engineering, and in particular, analysis, evolution, and (re)engineering communities.
Topics of interest include aspects listed for the main conference, but additional topics are welcome too. In particular:

+ Software Analysis, Parsing, and Fact Extraction
+ Software Reverse Engineering and Reengineering
+ Program Comprehension
+ Software Evolution Analysis
+ Software Architecture Recovery and Reverse Architecting
+ Program Transformation and Refactoring
+ Mining Software Repositories and Software Analytics
+ Software Visualization
+ Software Reconstruction and Migration
+ Software Maintenance and Evolution
+ Program Repair
+ Software Release Engineering, Continuous Integration and Delivery
+ Education related to all the above topics
+ Software design or engineering philosophies, practices, and tools
+ Adapting tools or processes to accommodate a range of organizational and cultural situations
+ Managerial or organizational aspects focused on people and their interactions
+ Teamwork, collaboration, or cooperation in or across various development teams and methodologies
+ Community-based software development (e.g., Open Source, crowdsourcing, etc.)
+ Stakeholder participation within and across phases
+ Processes and tools to support communication, collaboration, and cooperation among stakeholders

## Categories

Submitted papers should fit into one of the following categories.

### Empirical Papers

Empirical utilization or evaluation of theoretical or practical tools, methodologies, techniques of humanities to address software engineering-related problems and research issues. We encourage researchers to submit parts of their already presented works about the successful application of humanities-related methodologies. Negative results are also welcomed.

### Methodological Papers

Adaptation of theoretical or practical frameworks, mindsets, methodologies of humanities in the context of software engineering-related problems and research issues. Submissions may contain a methodological description of the possible application of humanities-related methods without any empirical evaluation yet.

## Submissions and Formatting

All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the [IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the `compsoc` or `compsocconf` option. Also, papers must comply with the [IEEE Policy on Authorship](https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/authorrightsresponsibilities.html).

All submissions must be in English. Submissions should not exceed 8 pages including references, figures and appendices, and should be uploaded electronically in PDF format via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=human22). Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.

## Double-blind Review Process

We will follow the full double-blind review process as determined by the main conference. In order to be compliant with the double-blind policy, submitted papers must adhere to the following rules.

+ Author names and affiliations must be omitted.
+ References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not "We build on our previous work..." but rather "We build on the work of...")
+ There may be cases in which the current submission is clear follow up of one of your previous work, and despite what recommended in the previous point, reviewers will clearly associate authorship of such a previous work to the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: "based on previous results [10]" .. where the reference is reported as "[10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted per double blind reviewing." In doing so, however, please make sure that the submission is self-contained and its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper.
+ Do not include acknowledgements of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgements in the camera-ready version.
+ If you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead.
+ Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say "The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course." You can of course add the institutional information in the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply for work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid to mention the organization's name. Instead, you may just refer the organization as "Org" or "Company", etc. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company's name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, videogame development company, etc.).
+ Avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. You may post anonymized links (with a warning that following said link may reveal authors' identities), include links to anonymized code or deployments. When creating such repositories, a good practice can be asking somebody in your team to test the anonymization of the repository and of its content. In case anonymization is difficult to be achieved and you still want to provide availability of data/tools, you can simply state that you will link to the code or deployment in the camera-ready version. Program committee members are asked to keep into account the double-blind policy when reviewing papers, and therefore not requiring full availability of artifacts at submission time.

## Publications

All accepted workshop papers will be published together with the SANER 2022 proceedings.
